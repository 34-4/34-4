Reverse Engineering & Game Modding
Started modding apps in 2022–2023 by experimenting with assets, icons, and functionality.

Use reverse engineering as a way to learn more about software design.

I don’t publish hacks or cracked apps — findings are for personal research and often reported to developers.
